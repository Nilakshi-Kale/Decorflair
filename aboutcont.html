        <h3>Commercial & Hospitality Design</h3>
        While we have previously focused our energy solely on the residential sector, we are excited to now offer commercial and hospitality design as well. This division of Brown will deliver strategic interior design planning and environmental branding to transform hotels, restaurants, luxury multi-family properties, retail, commercial spaces, and more! We're prepared to bring our firm's renowned experience, creativity, and design principles to this new sector.
    
        <h3>Our Vision</h3>  
        We are intent on establishing Brown as the premier design firm in South Florida while maintaining our unyielding ideals. Our guiding principles ensure that we convey a passion for the client and consistently deliver the greatest possible service experience; apply the highest standards of design excellence; and continually strive to enhance our contributions to the community.



        Our vision to create a memorable brand experience for our clients while enhancing the quality of life for all we serve.
