    <p>How you treat your customers tells them a lot about who you are as a brand. While a positive experience can make them likely to recommend you to others, a negative experience is even more likely to make them warn others against using your company.
    <br>
    <br>
        This is why it's essential to nurture customers you have and build positive, long-lasting relationships with them. If they feel they have a real connection with you and are valued by your company, they will gain a sense of brand loyalty.
        <br>
        <br>
        With the world becoming increasingly digital, consumers have come to expect brands to be responsive and approachable, so communication must be a top priority for your company. Customers want quick resolutions to any issues they may be having â€“ they don't want to be on the phone waiting on hold for an hour, or waiting days for a reply to an email. By instilling a 24/7 philosophy towards customer service, you can provide high-quality support any time of the day for customers in any timezone across the world.

        <br>
        Social media dominates much of the online experience, so it's only natural for users to reach out to brands on social media channels with support queries. Many consumers also feel going down this avenue is likely to get them a faster response too due to the public nature of social media.
        <br>
        <br>
        Once a customer reaches out to you, you're up against the clock - as you'll only remain on their minds for a short period of time. This means response time is critical if you want to foster positive relationships with your customers. If you treat the needs of your customers with the same urgency that you would treat your own, it will help you employ strategies that help attract new customers and grow your business further.
